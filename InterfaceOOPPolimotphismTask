Python Mission - Practice basic linux  with OOP

1. Basic vital parameters monitoring:
* Interface status
* IP adresses (per available interface)
* MAC address
* IP-Route status
* List of pci-e devices
* Internet connection)
2. Configure tool for new static IP + default SM if not givven



Thinking in text:

to get prepaed for this OOP mission, I want to implement the following subjects:

OOP & Polymorphism: 
Interface Abstract class: include (each interface have the same charactiristics (IP/MAC+UP\DOWN)) - So It's not a
good idea to make Interface as the abstract class, need to think about other 'character' that has many different uses
but with a few defferent uses.
bash commands

Polymorphism  - Interface class, which includes abstract method of setting up ip configuration , Polymo' will get in with a new Bond class that uses the setting IP method with a bit different use.
