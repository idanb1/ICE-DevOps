DevOps home task description:


Please write a bash script with 2 functions
first function will return the list of files in a folder in ascending order.

second function will return the list of files in a folder in descending order.

the bash program will get as a parameter the requested operation, and the folder full path,

and outputs the function results.

keep in mind syntax validation

Please write a bash one-liner command that will test if a range of ip addresses in a 24 subnet range is occupied
for example: give the cidr 10.5.99.0/24

you should print out back which ip addresses are taken.

Guidelines:

1. a trial to test if address is occupied is sufficient

2. do not print the trial, print a message only if you find an occupied address which includes the address.

for example: "ip 10.5.99.20 is occupied"

Write a bash or python (your choice) script that checks for files that are duplicates, even if they have a different name, and does so for directories specified by the user - duplicate files required to have same file name or equal data(one of the temrs) ?
